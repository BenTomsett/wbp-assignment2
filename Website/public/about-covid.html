					Face Coverings are important to reducing the transmission of COVID-19.  It’s important to wear masks in crowded places such as shops and public transport, and it is enforced by law due to the effectiveness.

					<b>How is a mask effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19?</b>
					<br>
					Masks reduce the transmission of airborne particulates whilst breathing or talking, therefore reducing the risk of someone coming in contact with COVID-19.  Masks are worn to protect others, not yourself.
