					Face Coverings are important to reducing the transmission of COVID-19.  It’s important to wear masks in crowded places such as shops and public transport, and it is enforced by law due to the effectiveness.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>How is a mask effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19?</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					Masks reduce the transmission of airborne particulates whilst breathing or talking, therefore reducing the risk of someone coming in contact with COVID-19.  Masks are worn to protect others, not yourself.

					If you have any of the main symptoms of coronavirus: Get a test to check if you have coronavirus as soon as possible. You and anyone you live with should stay at home and not have visitors until you get your test result – only leave your home to have a test.

					<br>
					If you test positive you will need to self-isolate for at least 10 days after the last member of your household tests positive.
					<br>
					<br>
					You should also notify anyone you’ve been in contact within the last 14 days.

					Washing hands can keep you healthy and prevent the spread of respiratory and diarrheal infections from one person to the next.  By washing your hands for at least 20 seconds you reduce the risk of inadvertently carrying COVID-19 on your hands.
